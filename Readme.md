*Given a program to pick a random number between 1 and 1000 which allows the user to guess the number giving feedback of either higher, lower or correct what is the minimum possible number of guesses to get the correct answer?*

To minimize the number of guesses required to find the correct number in a range of 1 to 1000, you can use a binary search algorithm. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.

In this case, the user's guess will split the remaining search space in half each time. So, after each guess, you're effectively eliminating half of the remaining possibilities.

Here's how it works:

1. Initially, the range is from 1 to 1000.
2. The first guess is in the middle of the range, which is 500.
3. If the user's guess is higher than 500, then the number you're looking for must be between 501 and 1000.
4. If the user's guess is lower than 500, then the number you're looking for must be between 1 and 499.
5. You repeat this process, continually halving the remaining search space, until you find the correct number.

Using binary search, the worst-case scenario would require log2(1000) guesses, where log2 represents the logarithm base 2. 

So, log2(1000) is approximately 9.966, which means you'd need at most 10 guesses to find the correct number, as you can't have a fraction of a guess.

Thus, the minimum possible number of guesses to get the correct answer using this algorithm is 10.
